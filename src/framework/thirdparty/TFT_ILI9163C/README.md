<b>1.0p7 Version Features, Fixes and Updates:</b><br>
- [ ]  **Bug Fix**  Scroll, should fix for all display's.
- [x]  **Bug Fix**  Fixed a language typo (horrible, sorry!) grandient is now gradient (thanks Giulio!)
- [x]  **Added** AVR code fixed, added a parameter in user setting to optimize the size of the code in AVR.
- [x]  **Added** setCursor can use a keyword called 'CENTER' in x, y or both. It will center text (regardless font size, etc.) es. _setCursor(CENTER,x);_ will center incoming text on x axis
- [x]  **Added** New font parameter inside Font File. It allows automatical char reassign (es. minus to capital). Useful for include small font file that uses less resources.
- [x]  **Added** char reassign using scheme inside font file.
- [x]  **Added** Multiple instances! There's a setting where you can enable multiple instances support.
However it uses slight more resources (this is why I add a setting). With multiple instances you can have 2 or more display's (even different type) sharing same pins (apart CS) and fonts!
- [x]  **Added** Multiple instances. Automatically avoid multiple SPI initializations thanks to an internal instances counter.
- [x]  **Added** getMode().
- [x]  **Added** Display files now handle any possible type of offset and can correct even upside-down screen. This allow you use any type of display without change a line of code.
- [x]  **Added** getScrollTop and getScrollBottom.
- [x]  **Added** Draw Arc Disable (#define _ILI9163C_DRAWARC) in settings. Saves resources if not used.
- [x]  **Added** drawImage! There's a template & preset for converting images (for lcd-image-converter), See examples!
- [x]  **Added** drawIcon! Got a lot of requests and now working. There's a template & preset for converting images (for lcd-image-converter), See examples!
- [x]  **Added** drawImage. Added optional parameters (NONE,TRANSPARENT,REPLACE,BOTH)
- [x]  **Added** drawIcon now use LGPO. Added transparency (set background as foreground and...voilÃ ), added inverse.
- [x]  **Fixed** setCursor now works as it should on any rotation
- [x]  **Fixed** drawCircle(). better rounded.
- [x]  **Fixed** LGPO Rendering engine issue on background font fixed.
- [x]  **Fixed** fixed almost all compiling errors with some compilers.
- [x]  **Fixed** Handle correctly PROGMEM, fixed Avr code side.
- [x]  **Fixed** LGPO bug with last font lines fixed. Faster rendering as well.
- [x]  **Updated** LGPO now can used to render any sequence of byte formatted image (also inverted).
- [x]  **Updated** fillScreen(color1,color2) for create gradient backgrounds. now amazing fast!
- [x]  **Updated** fillRect(x,y,w,hcolor1,color2) for create gradient rects. now amazing fast!
- [x]  **Updated** Fonts. Modified template to 2.3.
- [x]  **Updated** Fonts. Possible change the default font or even avoid completely to save space
- [x]  **Updated** scroll Up/Down now possible.
- [x]  **Updated** changeMode() now handle display on/off and works correctly.
- [x]  **Updated** all examples revised.
- [x]  **Updated** AVR code faster, user can decide optimizations speed/size
- [x]  **Updated** ESP8266 code is faster!.
- [x]  **Updated** Multiple instances fixed with all CPU (but you need separate DC and CS for each display).
- [x]  **Deprecated** drawColorBitmap(). use drawIcon().
- [x]  **Deprecated** display(). use changeMode(DISP_ON/DISP_OFF) instead.
- [x]  **Deprecated** setTextSize(). use setTextScale() instead.
- [x]  **Deprecated** Adafruit-GFX (never again!).

<b>Pay Attention to connections!!!!:</b><br>
	
- This display has logic at 3V3 volt so YOU NEED A VOLTAGE CONVERTER if you plan to use with arduino 5V.<br>
If you try to connect directly you can burn it very fast so PAY ATTENTION!<br>
- My display works at 3V3 volt and uses 3V3 for logic but LED background has resistor for 5V, hovewer the new one from 2016 has no resistor at all so they needs one and can work at 3v3, try with a 150Ohm first! Before connect display please check this or you will fry the backlight and your TFT will remain dark or change background color forever <br>
- Library works only in SPI mode by using MOSI,SCLK and a CS pin plus an additional pin for DC (called also A0).<br>
Optionally you can use the reset pin but you can avoid it by pullup with a resistor (anithing between 4k7 to 10K connected at 3v3 will fine), in that case do not set the rst pin in the instance .<br>
- Teensy 3 and LC cannot use any pin for CS and DC (or A0) but should be choosen as follow:<br>
 pins:2,6,9 or 10,15 or 20,13 for CS and RS.<br>
The benchmark.ino example has a routine that can help you to understand if you have choosed the right pin for your Teensy.<br>
For reset you can use any pin, if you want to save a wire and not use reset, YOU SHOULD CONNECT TO 3V3 OR USE
A PULLUP RESISTOR (4.7K to 3V3) BUT NOT LEAVE FLOATING!<br>

<b>IDE and compilers:</b><br>
	
I have succesfully tested with Arduino IDE 1.6.9, latest Teensyduino, VisualStudio 2015 with Arduino plugin.
Potentially any IDE should work but be sure is not too old! Arduino prior 1.5 should be avoided since there's not
SPI transaction support and lack of many fixes<br>

<b>Fonts:</b><br>

From this version fonts, icons and images can be shared between all my display libraries, working in the xact same way. To convert you own font, follow wiki!<br>
I provide templates and presets for LCD Image Converter inside _utilities folder.<br>

<b>Backgrounds:</b><br>
	
I got one of those displays from a chinese ebay seller but unfortunatly I cannot get
any working library so I decided to work on it. ILI9163C looks pretty similar to other 
display driver but it uses it's own commands so it's tricky to work with it unlsess you
carefully fight with his gigantic and confused datasheet.
My display it's a 1.44"", 128x128 that suppose to substitute Nokia 5110 LCD and here's the 
first confusion! Many sellers claim that it's compatible with Nokia 5110 (that use a philips
controller) but the only similarity it's the pin names since that this one it's color and
have totally different controller that's not compatible. Altrough I discovered that it's not
128x128 but 128x160 with offset (!??)... Check links below to see if it's similar to yours.
UPDATE:<br>
Some chinese seller use is own way to connect display to the TFT and since ILI chip is on TFT flat cable is not easy to discover, the library currently support any version at the time I'm writing this but library is able to support any possible future version, if you have any other strain of this display let me know!<br>
	
An example of the old RED PCB One:<br>

<br>An example of the RED PCB one (2016) with yellow pin (smaller)<br>

http://r.ebay.com/RoKYq9

<br>An example of BLACK PCB one<br>

http://r.ebay.com/tNE6Mg
	
	This TFT it's really cheap but has surprising features since it support very high speed SPI trasfer 
	(over 40Mhz tested!) and can be used as frame buffer, colors are quite tunable and has a tons of settings.
	It also support repetitive serial transfer so it can react very fast.
	
<b>BLACK, RED or ...</b>
	
	There's different strain of this display on ebay, I have try to tracking all of them but may missing some 		species! Actually the more popular has a RED pcb and a BLACK pcb that are completely same pcb but mount a 		different display that need some tweaking, in particular RED ones need offset but also some tweak for 			colors, etc. Recently, in 2016, another RED PCB display spreaded around, it has yellow pin instead black, it uses different tft so parameters are different too.In the .h file in the library try to comment out one of the presets:
	//#include "../_display/TFT_ILI9163C_BLACK_PCB.h"
	#include "../_display/TFT_ILI9163C_RED_PCB_OLD.h"//the old one
	//#include "../_display/TFT_ILI9163C_RED_PCB_YPIN.h"//the yellow pin one
	From version 1.r6 display data it's located inside _display folder, you can easily duplicate one of this files,
	rename it and include in _settings/TFT_ILI9163C_settings.h.

<b>The release 1.0 it's standalone and NOT NEED adafruitGFX!</b>

For the SD you can choose SdFat from greiman or the optimized Paul Stoffregen's SD
https://github.com/greiman/SdFat

    	
<b>Wiring:</b>

	You are a newbie and need help? Here's:
	This display has 8 pin (at the time I'm writing this):
	
	TFT side   -------------------- microprocessor  
	- Vcc		-->		+3V3V(!!!!)
	- Gnd		-->		Gnd
	- CS		-->		CS pin (3v3 level!)
	- RST		-->		(optional) connect to a MCU pin or tie to +3V3 or 4k7..10K to 3V3 (do NOT leave float!)
	- A0		-->		DC or RS pin (3v3 level!)
	- SDA		-->		Mosi (3v3 level!)
	- SCK		-->		Sclk (3v3 level!)
	- LED		-->		Some display need a resistor (see note below)

	TFT side   -------------------- ESP8266  
	- Vcc		-->		+3V3V(!!!!)
	- Gnd		-->		Gnd
	- CS		-->		D0
	- RST		-->		D2 (optional) if not used tie to +3V3 or 4k7..10K to 3V3 (do NOT leave float!)
	- A0		-->		D1
	- SDA		-->		Mosi (D7)
	- SCK		-->		Sclk (D5)
	- LED		-->		Some display need a resistor (see note below)
	
	Use the last version of ESP8266 or it will probably fail, it works much better
	with SPI and it's overall better than stable version.
	
* Note about led:<br>


Some display have an internal resistor to limit current, you see on the back of the display, following LED pcb
trace with your eyes and if you see a resistor (100 Ohm mine) you can connect this line directly to +5V (but try first 3V3!!!).<br>
But be careful <u>do not try connect to 5V before you check the presence of this resistor on pcb</u>, you can try first by using a resistor of 220 ohm, if the image looks very dark, try 100 and if still very dark, use lower values.<br>
The yellow pin RED PCB has a weak resistor, do not tie to 5V or you destroy the backlight, try use 100Ohm resistor.<br>

<b>Just a note about ESP8266:</b><br>
I've recently discovered that ESP8266 (NodeMCU 0.9 and NodeMCU 1.0 boards at list) has a weak SCLK output that vary from module to module, I really don't know why but voltage goes around 1.7 to 2.5 volt max. This should not be a problem for a SPI device but connecting more devices or some type of chip buffer can be problem! My 74HC125N for example do not work well. It's just a note ut I will investigate in future but please if you connect several SPI devices and not nothing work take count of this and do not apology!<br>
